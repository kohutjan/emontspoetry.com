    <html>Hmm, singer-songwriting. It would seem like a natural thing for someone
      writing poetry and playing some instruments. But weirdly, it is not just
      a combination of these two worlds but something new. Lyrics and poetry
      are different. Trust me, if you read poetry and lyrics for some time,
      you will notice quite a difference. Some lyrics may resemble poetry more,
      some poetry might by more like lyrics, but they are different. You quickly
      realize this when you just write some peace of poetry and add some chords
      over it. It does not work.

      For me, it is about the connection between the lyrics and the music.
      Ideally, it should be so closely tight that it should be almost
      impossible to "get the message" without listening to the music and
      listening to the lyrics together. This connection is a world for itself.
      New possibilities to express yourself, to grasp something ungraspable.
      It took me a long time to realize this. It was probably the main reason
      I never liked what I wrote. It always felt like there is no real need
      for the music or for the lyrics. It never felt like me, until very recently.
