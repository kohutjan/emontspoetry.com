      Open space
      Brown leaves
      Falling up your mind
      Golden sun
      Pouring
      Your screwed heart

      And in this vast land
      You are reaching the sky
      Praying to God
      With your mouth shut
      Forever silent
      Forever silent

      But in the end
      When you’re alone
      In the end
      When there’s nothing to
      You whisper…
      Whisper for…

      Someone you can tell your truths
      Someone who can hide your shoes
      Someone…
      Someone…

      You are grasping
      Through the endless mist
      Where there’s no point
      In going further nor back
      So, you just like
      What the fuck…

      I better lie down
      Among the leaves
      I better lie down
      Breathe it

      This openness, vastness, endlessness
      This openness, vastness, endlessness (outside of me)
      This openness, vastness, endlessness (in me)

      And I’m tired of new endings
      I’m gonna believe in something
      To hold on to
      To be content

      Cause in each
      Alone
      Cause in each
      Nothing to

      So, you whisper…
      For…

      Someone you can tell your truths
      Someone who can hide your shoes
      Someone…
      Someone…
      Someone
      I’m whole all alone
      Yet, someone
      Whole all alone
      Whole all alone
      Whole all alone
      Whole all alone
      But to stand beside someone…

    <title>A Belief of My Own</title>

      I always got a fever when I’m leaving home
      I always got a reason when I’m feeling low
      Will my oceans ever change my shores?
      I’m always trying to reach beyond
      To touch the place where we belong
      But it will take everything from me
      Maybe then I will be free
      Maybe then I will be

      So, I pick up my bag
      Full of books to be read
      But what if I lose it all?
      I cannot, I will not, I should not
      I’ll be spending my sleepless nights
      At the airport of forgotten land
      Forgotten land

      And I’ll be wayfarer, wayfarer
      Feeling low and high again
      Wayfarer, wayfarer…
      To be wayfarer, wayfarer
      Feeling low and high again
      Wayfarer, wayfarer…

      I was walking through the marshes lone
      And I was scared by a creature because I scared it
      We both felt that loneliness was ours
      So we drifted apart in a rush
      And I was left with a thought from the past
      That I was lesser among the spirits of this land
      Maybe one day I’ll join them
      Maybe one day I’ll join

      I pick up my notes
      Full of poems to be closed
      But what if I change it all?
      I can do, I will do, I should do
      I’ll be spending my joyful days
      Inside the house of forgotten land
      Forgotten land

      Going through motions
      Finding solutions
      Inside a belief of my own
      Holding myself
      Outside the illusion of the real
      Let my dream always be, always be
      Closer to the truth than it used to be
      Always be, always be
      Closer to the truth than it used to be
      Let me always be closer to the truth
      Than I used to…

      And I always got a fever when I’m leaving home

    <title>Winter Air</title>

      I’ve got something on my mind
      You’ve got something on yours
      Let’s play fair play all day long
      You hug your knees and you seek me
      Hello, what you’ve been doing?
      I’ve been lost all night long
      But now morning’s coming with you next to me
      It feels like returning

      Outside the window a cold wind
      Today we just stay in
      We will be dwelling in passing time
      But Jack is coming at 9 o’clock
      We got wishes to work on
      Just two more and it will be done
      We fill our little cups, on the bottom we feel
      The earth of Colombia where the Sun heats

      Winter’s dreaming
      About the air you breathe in
      Winter’s dreaming
      Inside the air you breathe in

      Mary, what are you doing?
      Don’t be afraid to come in
      Sometimes even you need a shelter
      Join us at the table
      Pour yourself a punch
      We will philosophize about our lives
      Through this gibberish we come closer to truth
      That does not belong to me or to you
      Oh, foolish dreams that suck our souls
      It’s in between where we belong

      It’s time to go sleep
      Mary, we wish you good rest

      And as for you
      I am glad
      That I’ve got someone to say farewell
      For tonight I wander
      For tonight I’m lost again
      But morning will always come

      Winter’s dreaming
      About the air you breathe in
      Winter’s dreaming
      Inside the air you breathe in

      Winter’s dreaming
      About the air you breathe in
      Winter’s dreaming
      Inside the air you breathe in
