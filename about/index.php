          Hi, my name is Jan Kohút (Honza). I spent my childhood in a little village
          called Velká nad Veličkou. After finishing primary school, I went to
          Uherské Hradiště to study grammar school. It was there where I first
          started to wonder about music, prose, lyrics, poetry, etc. Well, to
          put it simply, about art. It was not only about wonder but also about
          first attempts to create something mine. First tones on the guitar,
          first lines of poetry, now, for a good reason, forever forgotten.
          After graduation, I continued to Brno (the second-largest city in the
          Czech Republic) to study information technology. I began to take
          photos and be more engaged in poetry. I watched tons of tutorials
          about photography and editing. For the first time, I didn't consider
          my singing to be totally out of tune. I read wonderful books about
          the "rules" of poetry by Mary Oliver and I could not resist the
          thought of accepting her as my teacher. After I received my master's
          degree, I was kind of lost. I realized my nihilistic attitude towards
          life and I knew I had to step further. Towards a belief, an axiom of
          my own. An endless journey without an end. And so a new era of
          searching has begun.

          Currently, I'm 26 and I study PhD at the Information Technology Faculty
          of Brno University of Technology. I love to play the guitar, clarinet,
          piano, and ukulele. I'm not a pro musician and I learned everything by
          myself. On the guitar, piano, and ukulele, I love to play folk/indie
          music. On the clarinet, I love to play folklore music, which is specific
          to our region Horňácko. I also like to dance folklore dances with my
          folklore group Velička. Apart from poetry, I read mostly classical
          novels and sometimes I read fantasy series. Every year I go
          snowboarding to the Alps and I also know how to ski. My favourite
          activity is hiking, ideally with poles for nordic walking. When it
          comes to my job/school, I'm mostly interested in artificial
          intelligence, mainly neural networks. As for now, I'm working on text
          recognition (OCR).

          First, I "hated" poetry because I couldn’t understand it. But then I
          realized that you should not even try to understand it. This realization
          freed me, and I started to enjoy it. I realized that there were people
          in this world that wrote poetry that I loved. I realized that to found
          one poem that is perfect for you is often more than to read a whole
          novel. I can spend hours reading poetry and not find anything I like.
          Often it just doesn’t speak to me on any level. But I try to overcome
          it so I could reach the ones I'm going to love. And if I was to find
          one poem in a hundred that I would love, it would be enough for me.
          It would worth the fight.

          When it comes to writing poetry, it is often little things happening
          in daily life that inspire me. It can be a smell, touch, look, the
          way someone says something etc. I realized that the poems I wrote
          based on these little things are often the best ones. I believe that
          by capturing little things, and anything that comes out of it, you
          are getting closer and closer to the meaning of life, or whatever
          you wish to call it. On the contrary, sometimes I try to write about
          big things, about something really complicated. It usually ends up
          as a mess. I mean it's quite confusing and it's not offering you
          something to hold on to.

          I decided to buy my first camera (Sony a6000) thanks to my friend whos
          photos inspired me. At first, I was interested in photographing people
          that I knew and somehow captured the essence of what they were. Then I
          also started to be interested in landscape photography. But generally,
          I shoot anything that seems interesting to me. Lately, I'm trying to
          get better in video. Now I'm using a Sony a6500 camera and a Sigma
          16mm and a Sigma 30mm lenses. I use Capture One for editing.

          I love to capture the typical faces of people. I don’t strive for
          "fakeish" smiles and poses. I try to capture the moment. You can
          realize that this is quite similar to what I'm trying to do in poetry.
          In these moments you can see the true nature of life or whatever you
          wish to call it. As for the landscape, I like it because of nature.
          Somehow it has this ability to overcome you and I try to capture this
          in my landscape photos. Whether I use a wide lens to capture huge
          mountains or a long lens to capture some details. I also like to
          experiment, so I might shoot something weird from time to time.

          Hmm, singer-songwriting. It would seem like a natural thing for someone
          writing poetry and playing some instruments. But weirdly, it is not just
          a combination of these two worlds but something new. Lyrics and poetry
          are different. Trust me, if you read poetry and lyrics for some time,
          you will notice quite a difference. Some lyrics may resemble poetry more,
          some poetry might by more like lyrics, but they are different. You quickly
          realize this when you just write some peace of poetry and add some chords
          over it. It does not work.

          For me, it is about the connection between the lyrics and the music.
          Ideally, it should be so closely tight that it should be almost
          impossible to "get the message" without listening to the music and
          listening to the lyrics together. This connection is a world for itself.
          New possibilities to express yourself, to grasp something ungraspable.
          It took me a long time to realize this. It was probably the main reason
          I never liked what I wrote. It always felt like there is no real need
          for the music or for the lyrics. It never felt like me, until very recently.

          This website is solely my creation. I'm most indebted to the team of
          people responsible for
          <a class="text-decoration-none text-dark" href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.
          It allows you to create a
          responsive website without the need to mess around with CSS and
          Javascript too much. After you click on any picture in my gallery,
          you find yourself inside
          <a class="text-decoration-none text-dark" href="https://blueimp.github.io/Gallery/" target="_blank">blueimp Gallery</a>,
          which I'm thankful for.
          I'm using only open-source code, so I'm also making this open-source.
          You can find the code on <a class="text-decoration-none text-dark" href="https://github.com/kohutjan/emontspoetry.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
          The idea behind this website is to
          make an addition of new content as simple as possible. I've achieved
          this by simple XML files where I can define the content. These XML
          files are processed by PHP scripts which generate the HTML pages.
          As these rather simple and fast PHP scripts are running on the server,
          the client receives the final HTML page and there is almost no need
          for Javascript.

      </div>
      <div class="col-xl-4 col-md-6">
        <div class="justify poems-font">
          As for the content, I like the idea of DIY (do it yourself), so
          everything is by me (if not explicitly stated otherwise). I would
          like to keep this page as pure and peaceful as possible. A place
          where you can explore everything there is without being attacked
          by adds, meaningless comments, likes, dislikes, hashtags, etc.
          On the other hand, I'm most eager for any meaningful conversation
          about anything you can find on this website.  There is no option
          to leave a message directly, but you can write me an email anytime.
